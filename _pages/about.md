Introduction
------
I am a Ph.D. student of Computer Science at the Nara Institute of Science and Technology (NAIST), where I am a member of the Internet Architecture and Systems Laboratory. 

I received the B.E. and M.E. degrees from Hiroshima City University and NAIST, respectively. I am currently pursuing Ph.D. degree with the Graduate School of Science and Technology, NAIST. From 2021 to 2023, I am a Research Fellow of the Japan Society for the Promotion of Science (DC2). 

My research mainly focuses on cybersecurity for cyber-physical systems and their networks. Particularly, I research how to evade the automotive intrusion detection system based on physical layer characteristics (e.g. voltage and delay-time), information entropy, kernel-level system information, and so on.
